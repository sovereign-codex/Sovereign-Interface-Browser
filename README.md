# Sovereign Interface Browser

This repository provides a human-facing interface for interacting with
Sovereign Intelligence systems.

---

## Role

The interface:
- displays system state
- renders decisions and explanations
- surfaces escalation paths

The interface does **not**:
- make decisions
- enforce rules
- modify behavior
- override constraints

---

## Authority

All decisions rendered here originate upstream and are governed by the
**Value Kernel v1.0.0**.

---

> This interface shows the system.  
> It does not become the system.
